ArgoCD Log Analyzer

Overview

This project provides a simple log analyzer for ArgoCD logs using a GPT-style model. It continuously tails an ArgoCD log file and analyzes each new log entry using Hugging Face's transformers library with GPT-2 as a placeholder.

Features

Uses a GPT-2 model to analyze log entries in real-time.

Continuously tails the ArgoCD log file.

Logs insights generated by the model.

Designed for integration with containerized logging infrastructure.

Requirements

Python 3.8+

Hugging Face transformers library

torch (for running the GPT model)

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>

Install dependencies:

pip install transformers torch

Configuration

Set the environment variable ARGOCD_LOG_PATH to specify the ArgoCD log file path. If not set, it defaults to:

/var/log/argocd/argocd.log

Usage

Run the script with:

python log_analyzer.py

How It Works

Loads a text-generation model (GPT-2 by default).

Continuously reads new lines from the ArgoCD log file.

Uses the model to generate an analysis for each log entry.

Outputs the analysis to the console.

Notes

In production, replace GPT-2 with a fine-tuned model for better accuracy.

Ensure the log file path is correctly configured.

Logging

The script logs all processing steps to standard output, making it compatible with container logging systems.

Example Output
