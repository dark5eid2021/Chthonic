# Explanation
# This script uses the Hugging Face transformers pipeline to load a GPT-2 model. In prod we need to swap in a more fine-tuned model
# It tails the ArgoCD log file (path set via an env var) and processes each new line
# For each log entry, it creates a prompt and generates an "analysis" using the model
# log messages are written to standard output sot hat they can be captured by the container's logging infra
